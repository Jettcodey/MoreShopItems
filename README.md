> Additional shopping shelves with increased shop loot

## Features

- Increased item spawn rate in the shop.
- Additional shelving for more of each item.

## Important

There are a LOT of config entries that change values which can mess up item spawning, so I'd recommend leaving everything at its default value. If you want to though, you can completely disable certain items. Be warned, disabling every item except health or upgrades seems to not work in the shop (I have no idea why).

## Potential Issues that will be addressed soon

Truck only has 16 upgrades spots, 16 small item spots, 8 large high item spots, 4 large plus item spots, 12 medium item spots, 12 health pack spots, and 4 large item spots.

There is potentially a loss of extra items, but the truck does spawn the "rest" after loading into the next level. I do plan to increase the storage in the truck.
